# Unlock Missed Achievements

## Description

Any achievements unlocked while playing offline are not awarded after
logging back into Steam/GOG. This mod checks your current game progress and
triggers unlock events for all achievements you've rightfully earned so they
appear on your account for the world to see.

This should also allow you to propagate achievements unlocked on console
using crossplay saves (untested).
